`github-pages` is a great place for blog hosting. Stable, no limit of size and totally free. The only unsatisfaction of me is that I can not edit and preview my blog on the blog comfortably. Usually, when I want to write or edit a blog, I have to open an editor on my laptop. The editor on github website is ok for laptop, but not for phone. So I made [GiG](github.com/timqian/GiG) -- it is a blog system using github repo as its backend, and user can edit, preview his post easier.

For now [GiG](github.com/timqian/GiG)  is only an MVP. I will continually upgrade it.
