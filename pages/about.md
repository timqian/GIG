## About GiG

[GiG](Content Management System using github as its backend ) is a Content Management System using github as its backend. 

The reason I made GiG is so that I can write, edit, preview my blog easier than just using github pages and [Jeycll](https://github.com/cancelzz/jeykll). 

I will constantly improve this project and add blogs into it. 
If you have any problem using GiG, feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/timqian/GiG/issues)

I feel good while building things, even better if other people find it useful.
